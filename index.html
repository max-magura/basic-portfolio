                Hello, my name is Max Magura and I am currently enrolled in the Vanderbilt University Coding Boot Camp. I currently work as a marketing manager for a national entertainment company in Nashville, TN
            </p>

            <p>
                I graduated with honors from Belmont University in 2013 with a degree in Entrepreneurship. After graduation, I worked in the music and event industry before moving to marketing. I have been in marketing for 4 years and in my current position for 2 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I am not working or studying, I enjoy going to concerts, watching movies, taking small hikes here in Nashville, playing disc golf, and spending time with my friends & my fianc√© and our Great Dane. 
            </p>
